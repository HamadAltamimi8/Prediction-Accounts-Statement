The "Prediction Accounts Statement" project uses advanced artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to revolutionize customer engagement strategies , This project aims to accurately forecast customer behaviors and transaction patterns , This innovation not only enhances customer interactions but also equips businesses with critical ideas to optimize operations,  drive growth, and create a new model for data-driven decision-making.

In the project I uses a linear regression model to predict account statements. It leverages Python libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `sklearn` for model building.

## Overview 

The Prediction Customer Accounts project great represents to transform how businesses identify, engage, to understand customers. Leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms and predictive analytics techniques, this project aims to unlock actionable ideas from the available data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Data Preprocessing

In the "Prediction Customer Accounts" project, we refine raw data through cleansing, transforming strings to numerical values, and crafting dummy variables for nuanced analysis. Our strategic feature engineering integrates and optimizes data, enhancing our model's interpretability and accuracy. We selectively retain only the most relevant data, ensuring our predictive model captures essential customer behaviors and preferences effectively.

And we used for Data Preprocessing : 
- groupby
- dummies
- merged
